This project will keep track of my notes, thoughts, musings, screenshots, and more as I study for competencies and certifications with the [Microsoft Partner Network (MPN)](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/)

# About this project

## Project scripts

Currently, there is only one script for this project - the obligatory `start` script we've come to know and love in our open-source world.

### start

The `npm start` script for this project will only work for folks that have access to a protected document. If you don't have access, don't worry about it.
