[Build and run a web application with the MEAN stack on an Azure Linux virtual machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-a-web-app-with-mean-on-a-linux-vm/) (~42 mins)

# Introduction

You're a software developer at an online retail store that specializes in children's books. You're building a new web site for your business. You haven't yet fully defined the exact needs for your site, but you'll be responsible for the site from start to finish. You have lots of experience in JavaScript, so you want to find a solution that plays well to your strengths.

You've heard about the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) and you know it uses JavaScript. So you decide to try it out by building a MEAN stack and a basic web application that stores information about books. You can use what you learned to get a jump-start on your new web site.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Decide if the MEAN web stack is right for you
- Create an Ubuntu Linux VM to host your web app
- Install the MEAN stack components on your VM
- Create a basic web app on your MEAN stack

## Prerequisites

- Experience using Bash from the command line
- Familiarity or interest in using JavaScript to build web applications

# Decide if MEAN is right for you

MEAN is a development stack for building and hosting web applications. MEAN is an acronym for its component parts: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.

The main reason you might consider MEAN is if you're familiar with JavaScript. Here are some other reasons you might want to choose MEAN, or choose a different development stack for your next web application.

## Why would I pick MEAN?

All of the components of the MEAN stack are reliable, well-understood, and open source, but so are many other development stacks. Here are some reasons you might choose MEAN over other development stacks.

### Your data isn't highly structured

MongoDB is what's called a **NoSQL** database. A NoSQL database doesn't require data to be structured in a pre-defined way as it would with a relational database like Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL. Instead, MongoDB stores its data in JSON-like documents that don't require the rigid data structures that MySQL or other relational databases require.

### MEAN is well documented

The components of the MEAN stack are all popular right now. Resources for working with MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js are easy to find.

### MEAN runs almost anywhere

You can also develop MEAN stack applications from your favorite development environment â€“ whether that's Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Why might MEAN not be right for me?

Here are some reasons you might want to choose a development stack other than MEAN.

Even if you decide that MEAN is not right for you, you might still be interested in this module. Many of the patterns you'll see apply to other kinds of web application frameworks.

### Your data is highly structured

If your data is highly structured, you might benefit from putting your data in a relational database such as Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL.

### JavaScript is not your strongest skill

If you prefer another language over JavaScript, there may be an alternative framework out there for you.

For example, the LAMP stack, which consists of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (sometimes with Perl or Python instead of PHP), might better align to your strengths and experience.
