[Choose a data storage approach in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-storage-approach-in-azure/) (~30 mins)

# Introduction

Data comes in different shapes and sizes, and no single storage solution fits all data. For example, an online retail website has a number of distinct data sets that are all used to run the business: product catalog data, media files like photos and videos, and financial business data. Each data set has different requirements, and it's your job to figure out which storage solution is best. The key factors to consider in deciding on the optimal storage solution are: how to classify your data, how your data will be used, and how you can get the best performance for your application.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Classify your data as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured
- Determine how your data will be used
- Determine whether your data requires transactions

# Classify your data

An online retail business has different types of data. Each type of data may benefit from a different storage solution.

Application data can be classified in one of three ways: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Here, you'll learn how to classify your data so that you can choose the appropriate storage solution.
