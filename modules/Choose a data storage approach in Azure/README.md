[Choose a data storage approach in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-storage-approach-in-azure/) (~30 mins)

# Introduction

Data comes in different shapes and sizes, and no single storage solution fits all data. For example, an online retail website has a number of distinct data sets that are all used to run the business: product catalog data, media files like photos and videos, and financial business data. Each data set has different requirements, and it's your job to figure out which storage solution is best. The key factors to consider in deciding on the optimal storage solution are: how to classify your data, how your data will be used, and how you can get the best performance for your application.
