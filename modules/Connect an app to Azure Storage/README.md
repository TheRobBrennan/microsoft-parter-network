[Connect an app to Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/connect-an-app-to-azure-storage/) (~1 hr 15 mins)

# Introduction

Imagine you're building a photo-sharing application. Every day, thousands of users take pictures and rely on your application to keep them safe and make them accessible across all their devices. Storing these photos is critical to your business, and you would like to ensure that the system used in your application is fast, reliable, and secure. Ideally, this would be done without you having to build all these aspects into the app.

Azure Storage provides such power, resiliency, and performance in the cloud. This module will provide you with the knowledge to be able to utilize the power of Azure Storage to achieve the reliability and performance in your app that you require. This knowledge can then be applied to any application.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Explore the data types and services supported by an Azure storage account.
- Create a new Azure storage account using the Azure portal.
- Create a new application and connect the app to an Azure Storage account.

## Prerequisites

Some programming experience in either C# or JavaScript is assumed.

# Explore Azure storage services

Let's start by taking a quick look at Azure storage services, data styles, and accounts.

Microsoft Azure Storage is a managed service that provides durable, secure, and scalable storage in the cloud. Let's break these terms down.

|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Durable  | Redundancy ensures that your data is safe in the event of transient hardware failures. You can also replicate data across datacenters or geographical regions for additional protection from local catastrophe or natural disaster. Data replicated in this way remains highly available in the event of an unexpected outage. |
| Secure   | All data written to Azure Storage is encrypted by the service. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Scalable | Azure Storage is designed to be massively scalable to meet the data storage and performance needs of today's applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Managed  | Microsoft Azure handles maintenance and any critical problems for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

A **single Azure subscription can host up to 200 storage accounts**, **each of which can hold 500 TB of data**. If you have a business case, you can talk to the Azure Storage team and **get approval for up to 250 storage accounts** in a subscription, which **pushes your max storage up to 125 Petabytes**!
