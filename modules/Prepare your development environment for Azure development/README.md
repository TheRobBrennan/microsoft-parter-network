[Prepare your development environment for Azure development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/prepare-your-dev-environment-for-azure-development/) (~28 mins)

# Introduction

Microsoft Azure enables you to quickly and efficiently build, deploy, monitor, and scale cloud hosted solutions. Azure's deployment model is flexible. For example, you can develop in Visual Studio, commit your code to GitHub, build with Azure DevOps, and then deploy to Azure. Or you could use a different integrated development environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, develop on Linux, and deploy directly from your development machine to the cloud.

Using Azure means you use your favorite IDE, you choose from a large range of development languages, from C# to Java to Node.js, and you choose your development operating system. Microsoft provides and supports a wide range of development tools for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Here, you'll learn how to set up your development environment with several popular IDEs.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Prepare your IDE for Azure development
- Set up Visual Studio Code
- Set up Visual Studio
- Set up Eclipse for Java development
- Set up IntelliJ IDEA for Java development

# Set up your development environment

Visual Studio Code is a popular choice for developing applications for Azure. It's lightweight, taking up only megabytes of storage space, and works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a free source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports hundreds of programming languages, includes Git integration, and is designed to connect to Azure cloud services.

However, Visual Studio Code doesn't include a compiler. Code compilation for specific languages and scenarios is added via extensions.

## Extension model

One of the most powerful features of Visual Studio Code is the extension model. Extensions extend the capabilities of Visual Studio Code to add a wide range of new capabilities. For example, extensions can be used to add compilers, add spell checking, and integrate with Azure services.

Extensions are free and can be added from the Extensions page within Visual Studio Code. You can explore the available extensions in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

## Azure extensions

Many of the extensions target Azure features and products. For example, there are extensions that provide features such as Docker support, subscription management, tooling for the Azure CLI, database access, and Azure Storage API integration.

## Install Visual Studio Code and prepare for Azure development

Visual Studio Code supports Windows, Linux, and macOS. To install Visual Studio Code, go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
