[Secure your Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/) (~1 hr 7 mins)

# Introduction

Data security is critical when protecting your customer's privacy and your organizationâ€™s reputation. Businesses have closed due to financial damage or ruined reputations. Customers have had their data accessed unlawfully because of security breaches exposing their personal details, and again, possibly causing financial harm.

Suppose you work at an online retailer. To support the online marketplace your company provides, you store an assortment of data from your customers, such as phone numbers, addresses, and credit cards. You also store data that is critical to the health of your business, such as financial account balances and intellectual property. If exposed or maliciously accessed it could jeopardize the health of your business and the trust your customers place in you. It's your responsibility to make sure this data stored in your databases is as secure as possible, to protect both your customer data and your business data.

Put yourself in the shoes of an attacker. If you were trying to maliciously attack a system, would a single layer of protection or multiple layers of protection make it more difficult to gain access to the data? Defense in depth is a strategy that employs a layered approach to slow the advance of an attack aimed at acquiring unauthorized access to information. Each layer provides protection so that if one layer is breached, a subsequent layer is already in place to prevent further exposure.

Azure SQL Database is a great service for the storage of relational data, and there are a number of built-in capabilities you can use to ensure your data is secure and practice defense in depth. We'll look at ways to secure your SQL database by configuring the database firewall, securing access, encrypting communication, and other techniques for database security. With this layered approach, you can help ensure your data is secure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Control network access to your Azure SQL Database using firewall rules
- Control user access to your Azure SQL Database using authentication and authorization
- Protect your data in transit and at rest
- Audit and monitor your Azure SQL Database for access violations

# Exercise - Set up sandbox environment

Here you'll set up the resources you'll need for use throughout this module. Let's envision a basic architecture consisting of a server hosting an application that your customers use, which connects to a database for the storage of its data. The application runs on a virtual machine, and the database has been recently migrated from a SQL Server database running on a VM to a database on the Azure SQL Database service. To show how you can secure your database, we're going to set up the following resources for use throughout this module:

- A Linux VM named _appServer_. This server will act as the application server that users would be connecting to, and will need to connect to the database. We'll install `sqlcmd` on the VM to simulate an application running on _appServer_ making connections to the database.
- An Azure SQL Database logical server. This logical server is needed to host one or more databases.
- A database on our logical server called _marketplaceDb_. We'll create it using the _AdventureWorksLT_ demo database so we have some tables and data to work with. This will include some sensitive data, such as email addresses and phone numbers that we'll want to make sure are properly secured.

Let's get things set up!
