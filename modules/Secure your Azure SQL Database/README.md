[Secure your Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/) (~1 hr 7 mins)

# Introduction

Data security is critical when protecting your customer's privacy and your organizationâ€™s reputation. Businesses have closed due to financial damage or ruined reputations. Customers have had their data accessed unlawfully because of security breaches exposing their personal details, and again, possibly causing financial harm.

Suppose you work at an online retailer. To support the online marketplace your company provides, you store an assortment of data from your customers, such as phone numbers, addresses, and credit cards. You also store data that is critical to the health of your business, such as financial account balances and intellectual property. If exposed or maliciously accessed it could jeopardize the health of your business and the trust your customers place in you. It's your responsibility to make sure this data stored in your databases is as secure as possible, to protect both your customer data and your business data.

Put yourself in the shoes of an attacker. If you were trying to maliciously attack a system, would a single layer of protection or multiple layers of protection make it more difficult to gain access to the data? Defense in depth is a strategy that employs a layered approach to slow the advance of an attack aimed at acquiring unauthorized access to information. Each layer provides protection so that if one layer is breached, a subsequent layer is already in place to prevent further exposure.

Azure SQL Database is a great service for the storage of relational data, and there are a number of built-in capabilities you can use to ensure your data is secure and practice defense in depth. We'll look at ways to secure your SQL database by configuring the database firewall, securing access, encrypting communication, and other techniques for database security. With this layered approach, you can help ensure your data is secure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Control network access to your Azure SQL Database using firewall rules
- Control user access to your Azure SQL Database using authentication and authorization
- Protect your data in transit and at rest
- Audit and monitor your Azure SQL Database for access violations

# Exercise - Set up sandbox environment

Here you'll set up the resources you'll need for use throughout this module. Let's envision a basic architecture consisting of a server hosting an application that your customers use, which connects to a database for the storage of its data. The application runs on a virtual machine, and the database has been recently migrated from a SQL Server database running on a VM to a database on the Azure SQL Database service. To show how you can secure your database, we're going to set up the following resources for use throughout this module:

- A Linux VM named _appServer_. This server will act as the application server that users would be connecting to, and will need to connect to the database. We'll install `sqlcmd` on the VM to simulate an application running on _appServer_ making connections to the database.
- An Azure SQL Database logical server. This logical server is needed to host one or more databases.
- A database on our logical server called _marketplaceDb_. We'll create it using the _AdventureWorksLT_ demo database so we have some tables and data to work with. This will include some sensitive data, such as email addresses and phone numbers that we'll want to make sure are properly secured.

Let's get things set up!

## Create an Azure SQL Database

First, let's set up some variables. Replace values below that are shown in `[]` with values of your choice. Note that the `[password]` must have at least eight characters and contain characters from at least three of these categories: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters. Save the login for use later.

```sh
# Set an admin login and password for your database
export ADMINLOGIN='rbadmin'
export PASSWORD='ViVKUwPtAdW2'
# Set the logical SQL server name. We'll add a random string as it needs to be globally unique.
export SERVERNAME=server$RANDOM
export RESOURCEGROUP=learn-de1b0057-e21d-46a6-a43e-44b6e36fc45e
# Set the location, we'll pull the location from our resource group.
export LOCATION=$(az group show --name $RESOURCEGROUP | jq -r '.location')
```

Run the following command to create a new Azure SQL Database logical server.

```sh
az sql server create \
    --name $SERVERNAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
    --location $LOCATION \
    --admin-user $ADMINLOGIN \
    --admin-password "$PASSWORD"
```

This will generate output:

```json
{
  "administratorLogin": "rbadmin",
  "administratorLoginPassword": null,
  "fullyQualifiedDomainName": "server18714.database.windows.net",
  "id": "/subscriptions/179dd20b-e2ea-45a0-8003-473940f3d4f1/resourceGroups/learn-de1b0057-e21d-46a6-a43e-44b6e36fc45e/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/server18714",
  "identity": null,
  "kind": "v12.0",
  "location": "westus",
  "minimalTlsVersion": null,
  "name": "server18714",
  "privateEndpointConnections": [],

  "state": "Ready",
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers",
  "version": "12.0"
}
```

Now run the following to create the database called **marketplaceDb** on the logical server you just created. This will use the _AdventureWorksLT_ database as a template so we'll have some pre-populated tables to work with.

```sh
az sql db create --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
    --server $SERVERNAME \
    --name marketplaceDb \
    --sample-name AdventureWorksLT \
    --service-objective Basic
```

This will generate output like:

```json

  "sourceDatabaseId": null,
  "status": "Online",
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases",
  "zoneRedundant": false
}
```

Let's do one last thing and get the connection string for this database.

```sh
az sql db show-connection-string --client sqlcmd --name marketplaceDb --server $SERVERNAME | jq -r
```

Your output resembles this. Keep this handy, you'll need this command to connect to your database later in this module. Note the `[username]` and `[password]` placeholders in the command that you will want to replace with the `ADMINLOGIN` and `PASSWORD` credentials you specified in variables earlier.

```sh
sqlcmd -S tcp:server18714.database.windows.net,1433 -d marketplaceDb -U <username> -P <password> -N -l 30

# Example command for my Azure sandbox to obtain the connection string will be
sqlcmd -S tcp:server18714.database.windows.net,1433 -d marketplaceDb -U rbadmin -P ViVKUwPtAdW2 -N -l 30
```

## Create and configure a Linux virtual machine

Now let's create the Linux VM that we'll use through some examples.

Run the following command to create the VM; this might take several minutes to complete.

```sh
az vm create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCEGROUP \
  --name appServer \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --size Standard_DS2_v2 \
  --generate-ssh-keys
```

When this command completes, you should see output that resembles the following example:

```json
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/179dd20b-e2ea-45a0-8003-473940f3d4f1/resourceGroups/learn-de1b0057-e21d-46a6-a43e-44b6e36fc45e/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/appServer",
  "location": "westus",
  "macAddress": "00-22-48-04-01-B6",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "40.112.170.37",
  "resourceGroup": "learn-de1b0057-e21d-46a6-a43e-44b6e36fc45e",
  "zones": ""
}
```

Once your VM is successfully created, connect to its public IP address using SSH.

```sh
ssh nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn

# Example where nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn is the value from the publicIpAddress output in the previous step.
ssh 40.112.170.37
```

Two things to note. First, we don't need a password because we generated an SSH key pair as part of the VM creation. Second, on the initial shell connection into the VM it will give you a prompt about the authenticity of the host. This occurs because we are connecting to an IP address instead of a host name. Answering "yes" will save the IP as a valid host for connection and allow the connection to proceed.

Now let's finish things up by installing mssql-tools on the Linux VM so we'll be able to connect to our database through sqlcmd.

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install -y mssql-tools unixodbc-dev
```

A lot of text will scroll by for some of these commands, so make sure you hit enter after the final command to ensure it runs.

We've created an Azure SQL Database logical server, a database on that logical server, and a virtual machine called _appServer_ that we'll use to simulate network connectivity from an application server. Let's take a look at how we can properly secure our database.

# Exercise - Restrict network access

Users will connect to our app server to enter orders, update their account, and perform similar activities, which will in turn update the database with these changes. Because we have personal data stored in the database it's critical to ensure that we only allow access from trusted and necessary resources. Let's take a look at a number of ways you can control access to your SQL database over the network.

## Firewall rules

Azure SQL Database has a built-in firewall that is used to allow and deny network access to both the database server itself, as well as individual databases. Initially, all public access to your Azure SQL Database is blocked by the SQL Database firewall. To access a database server, you must specify one or more server-level IP firewall rules that enable access to your Azure SQL Database. You use the IP firewall rules to specify which IP address ranges from the Internet are allowed, and whether Azure applications can attempt to connect to your Azure SQL Database.

Firewall rules are configured at the server and/or database level, and will specifically state which network resources are allowed to establish a connection to the database. Depending on the level, the rules you can apply will be as follows:

- Server-level firewall rules
  - Allow access to Azure services
  - IP address rules
  - Virtual network rules
- Database-level firewall rules
  - IP address rules

SQL Data Warehouse only supports server-level IP firewall rules, and not database-level IP firewall rules.

Let's take a closer look at how these rules work.

### Server-level firewall rules

These rules enable clients to access your entire Azure SQL server, that is, all the databases within the same logical server. There are three types of rules that can be applied at the server level.

The **Allow access to Azure services** rule allows services within Azure to connect to your Azure SQL Database. When enabled, this setting allows communications from all Azure public IP addresses. This includes all Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) services, such as Azure App Service and Azure Container Service, as well as Azure VMs that have outbound Internet access. This rule can be configured through the **ON/OFF** option in the firewall pane in the portal, or by an IP rule that has 0.0.0.0 as the start and end IP addresses.

![https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-allow-azure-services.png](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-allow-azure-services.png)

This rule is used when you have applications running on PaaS services in Azure, such as Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions, that need to access your Azure SQL Database. Many of these services don't have a static IP address, so this rule is needed to ensure they are able to connect to the database.

**IP address rules** are rules that are based on specific public IP address ranges. IP addresses connecting from an allowed public IP range will be permitted to connect to the database.

![https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-server-ip-rule-1.png](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-server-ip-rule-1.png)

These rules can be used when you have a static public IP address that needs to access your database. Note that **unless you allow an IP rule to have 0.0.0.0 as the start and end IP addresses, Azure Services will not have access by default**.

**Virtual network rules** allow you to explicitly allow connection from specified subnets inside one or more Azure virtual networks (VNets). Virtual network rules can provide greater access control to your databases and can be a preferred option depending on your scenario. Since Azure VNet address spaces are private, you can effectively eliminate exposure to public IP addresses and secure connectivity to those addresses you control.

![https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-vnet-rule.png](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database/media/2-vnet-rule.png)

Virtual network rules are used when you have Azure VMs that need to access your database.

For server-level rules, all of the above can be created and manipulated through the portal, PowerShell, the CLI and through Transact-SQL (T-SQL).

### Database-level firewall rules

These rules allow access to an individual database on a logical server and are stored in the database itself. **For database-level rules, only IP address rules can be configured.** They function the same as when applied at the server-level, but are scoped to the database only.

The benefits of database-level rules are their portability. When replicating a database to another server, the database-level rules will be replicated, since they are stored in the database itself.

The downside to database-level rules is that you can only use IP address rules. This may limit the flexibility you have and can increase administrative overhead.

Lastly, database-level firewall rules can be created and manipulated only through T-SQL.

## Restricting network access in practice

Whenever possible, as a best practice, use database-level IP firewall rules to enhance security and to make your database more portable. Use server-level IP firewall rules for administrators and when you have several databases with the same access requirements, and you don't want to spend time configuring each database individually.

Let's take a look at how these work in practice, and how you can secure network access to only allow what is necessary. Recall that we created an Azure SQL Database logical server, a database, and the _appServer_ Linux VM acting as an application server. This scenario is often seen when a database has been migrated to Azure SQL Database and resources inside of a virtual network need to access it. The firewall feature of Azure SQL Database can be used in many scenarios, but this is an example that has practical applicability and demonstrates how each of the rules functions.

Let's go through the firewall settings and see how they work. We'll use both the cloud shell and the portal for these exercises.

The database we created currently does not allow access from any connections. This is by design based on the commands that we ran to create the logical server and database. Let's confirm this.

In the cloud shell, SSH into your Linux VM if you aren't already connected.

```sh
ssh nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn

# Example where nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn is the value from the publicIpAddress output in the previous step.
ssh 40.112.170.37
```

Recall the `sqlcmd` command we retrieved earlier. Go ahead and run it to attempt to connect to the database. Make sure you replace [username] and [password] with the ADMINUSER credentials you specified in the previous unit. Make sure to keep the single quotes around the username and password so that any special characters aren't misinterpreted by the shell.

```sh
sqlcmd -S tcp:server18714.database.windows.net,1433 -d marketplaceDb -U 'rbadmin' -P 'ViVKUwPtAdW2' -N -l 30
```

You should receive an error when trying to connect. This is expected since we've not allowed any access to the database.

```sh
Sqlcmd: Error: Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server : Cannot open server 'server18714' requested by the login. Client with IP address '40.112.170.37' is not allowedto access the server.  To enable access, use the Windows Azure Management Portal orrun sp_set_firewall_rule on the master database to create a firewall rule for this IP address or address range.  It may take up to five minutes for this change to takeeffect..
```

Let's grant access so we can connect.

### Use the server-level allow access to Azure services rule

Since our VM has outbound internet access, we can use the **Allow access to Azure services** rule to allow access from our VM.

Sign into the Azure portal using the same account you activated the sandbox with.

In the **Search resources, services, and docs** box at the top, search for your database server name, `serverNNNN`. Select the SQL server.

In the SQL server panel, in the **Security** section in the left menu, select **Firewalls and virtual networks**.

Set **Allow access to Azure services** to **ON** and click **Save**.

Back in your SSH session, let's try to connect to your database again.

```sh
sqlcmd -S tcp:server18714.database.windows.net,1433 -d marketplaceDb -U 'rbadmin' -P 'ViVKUwPtAdW2' -N -l 30
```

At this point, you should be able to connect. If it's successful, you should see a `sqlcmd` prompt.

So we've opened up connectivity, but this setting currently allows access from _any_ Azure resource, **including resources outside of our subscription**. Let's restrict this further to limit network access to only resources that are within our control.

### Use a database-level IP address rule

Recall that database-level IP address rules allow only access to an individual database on a logical server. We'll use one here to grant access to the static IP of our _appServer_ VM.

To create a database-level IP rule, we'll need to run some T-SQL commands. You'll create a database rule using the following convention, where you pass in the rule name, the starting IP address, and the ending IP address. By specifying the start and end IP to be the same, we're limiting access to a single IP, though we could expand the range if we had a larger block of addresses that required access.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule N'My Firewall Rule', '40.112.128.214', '40.112.128.214'
```

While still at the `sqlcmd` prompt, run the following command, replacing the public IP address of your _appServer_ VM in both locations below.

TIP: When running T-SQL commands such as the following, the `GO` on the second line may not copy through to the `sqlcmd` prompt, so you will likely need to type this out. The T-SQL command won't execute without it, so make sure to run the `GO` command.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_set_database_firewall_rule N'Allow appServer database level rule', '40.112.170.37', '40.112.170.37';
GO
```

Once the command completes, type `exit` to exit `sqlcmd`. Remain connected via SSH.

In the portal, on the **Firewalls and virtual networks** panel for your SQL server, set **Allow access to Azure services** to **OFF** and click **Save**. This will disable access from all Azure services, but we'll still be able to connect since we have a database-level IP rule for our server.

Back in cloud shell, in the VM you are connected via SSH to, try connecting to your database again.

```sh
sqlcmd -S tcp:server18714.database.windows.net,1433 -d marketplaceDb -U 'rbadmin' -P 'ViVKUwPtAdW2' -N -l 30
```

Using a database-level rule allows access to be isolated specifically to the database. This can be useful if you'd like to keep your network access configured per database. If multiple databases share the same level of network access, you can simplify administration by using a server-level rule to apply the same access to all databases on the server.

#### Use a server-level IP address rule

```sh

```

```sh

```

```sh

```

#### Use a server-level virtual network rule

```sh

```

```sh

```
