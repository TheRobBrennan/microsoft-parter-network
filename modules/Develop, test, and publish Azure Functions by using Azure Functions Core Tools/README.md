# Notes and key takeaways

## Introduction

The Azure Functions Core Tools are command-line utilities that enable you to develop and run functions locally and publish them to Azure.

Suppose you're a developer for a car dealership chain. The sales people are always looking for ways to modernize their workflow. Your manager has decided to build a set of applications backed by Azure Functions. The first service he'd like built involves loan interest calculations. He's asked you to look into creating functions that can be called over the web to run loan interest calculations. You've decided to start by learning how to use the Azure Functions Core Tools to build and publish a function.

In this module, you'll use the Azure Functions Core Tools from the command line to create a new local functions project and function. You'll modify the starter code generated by the Core Tools to run a simple interest calculation and run the function locally to test it. When it's ready, you'll use the Azure CLI to create a function app in Azure, publish your function, then invoke it over the web.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to use the Core Tools from the command line to create and run functions locally and publish them to Azure.

This module's exercise can be completed in the browser, and doesn't require an Azure subscription or local development environment.

## Create and run Azure Functions locally by using the Core Tools

Here, you'll learn how to use the Core Tools to create and run functions locally.

### What are the Azure Functions Core Tools?

The Core Tools feature a variety of functions-related capabilities, but their primary purpose is to:

- Generate the files and folders you need to develop functions on your local computer
- Run your functions locally so you can test and debug them
- Publish your functions to Azure

The Core Tools are packaged as a single command-line utility named `func`. If you run `func` from the command line without any additional commands, it will display version information and a usage guide.

The Core Tools are standalone utilities, not an extension of a larger integrated development environment or tool. You can accomplish the above tasks with nothing but the command line and the Core Tools, and use any text editor you like to write code and modify configuration. In practice, you'll also need the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to log in to Azure and perform other management tasks.

Other Functions development tools, such as the Functions-related features in Visual Studio and the Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code, are built on top of the Core Tools.

#### Core Tools versions

In other documentation, you may see references to two different versions of the Core Tools: versions 1.x and 2.x. We recommend using the newest available revision of version 2.x, as it offers the best support for most scenarios and it can be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux computers.

We'll be discussing and using version 2.x in this tutorial, but you won't need to install anything on your own computer to complete it. We'll use the in-browser Cloud Shell environment for development, and the Core Tools are already installed there, along with the Azure CLI and a code editor.

#### Local development vs. Azure portal development

The Azure portal features a functions editor experience, but in most cases it does not support working with functions that were developed locally.

**Once you start using a local development workflow based on the Core Tools, don't expect to be able to use the portal to make changes to your functions.**

Let's start with the Core Tools by taking a closer look at how to create functions and run them locally. We'll look at how to publish to Azure later on in this tutorial.

### Creating functions locally

#### Function apps and functions projects

Every function published to Azure belongs to a function app: a collection of functions that are published together into the same environment. All of the functions in an app share a common set of configuration values, and must all be built for the same language runtime. Each function app is an Azure resource that can be configured and managed independently.

When you develop functions locally, you work within a functions project: a folder that contains the code and configuration files that define your functions. A functions project on your computer is equivalent to a function app in Azure, and can contain multiple functions that use the same language runtime.

To get started developing, you need to create a functions project folder that's organized correctly. Every new function you add to the project requires additional code and configuration that must be complete and correctly structured, or your functions will not be able to run. If you wanted to, you could become familiar with the names and contents of the files needed in a functions project folder and create them yourself, but doing so would be time-consuming and error-prone.

With the Azure Functions Core Tools, you'll never need to do this! You can use the Core Tools to generate function projects and functions from scratch.

#### Creating a new functions project with func init

To create a new functions project, run `func init` on the command line:

![https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-core-tools/media/2-func-init-output.png](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-core-tools/media/2-func-init-output.png)

`func init` will ask you which language runtime you'd like to use for the app and tailor the project folder's contents appropriately.

When you create a new functions project, the files included in the project folder depend on the language runtime you select. Regardless of the runtime you choose, the two most critical project files are always present:

- host.json stores runtime configuration values, such as logging options, for the function app. The settings stored in this file are used both when running functions locally and in Azure.
- local.settings.json stores configuration values that only apply to the function app when it is run locally with the Core Tools. This file contains two kinds of settings: local runtime settings, used to configure the local functions runtime itself, and custom application settings, which you can add and configure based on your app's needs and can be accessed and used by all the functions in the app.

Functions projects that `func init` generates don't have any functions in them. Let's find out how to add one.

#### Creating a new function with func new

Each individual function in a project requires code and configuration to define its behavior. Running func new in a functions project folder will create a new function and all the files you need to get started developing.

![https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-core-tools/media/2-func-new-output.png](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/develop-test-deploy-azure-functions-with-core-tools/media/2-func-new-output.png)

After asking you which kind of function trigger you want to use and what you'd like to name your function, func new will generate a complete, publish-ready starter implementation in your function project's chosen language. The starter code illustrates how to use the type of trigger you selected and is there to help you get started quickly: just replace the body of the function with your own implementation, and you're ready to build, run, test and publish.

In the next part of this tutorial, we'll use `func new` to create an HTTP-triggered function and modify the starter implementation to perform a simple interest calculation.

### Running functions locally

Functions aren't programs that can be run on their own: they must be hosted by the functions host. The host is what powers everything outside of your function code: it loads configuration, listens for triggers and HTTP requests, starts the worker process for the language your functions are written in, writes log output and more. In Azure, function apps run the function host automatically when they start.

You can use the Core Tools to run your own instance of the functions host and try out your functions locally before you publish them. By running your functions before publishing them, you can make sure your configuration and code loads correctly and test out your functions by making real HTTP calls to them without the need for Azure resources.

To start the functions host locally, run `func start` from a functions project folder. At the end of the output, the Core Tools will display local URLs you can use to call of each of your functions. While the host is running, you can use any tools or libraries that make HTTP calls, like curl, to interact with your functions. The Core Tools will write any log output produced by the host to the terminal in real time.
