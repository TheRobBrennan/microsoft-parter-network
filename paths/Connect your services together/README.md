[Connect your services together](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/connect-your-services-together/) - Estimated 3 hours 31 mins to complete

Azure lets you create applications composed of various components: web site front-ends, back-end services, and triggered functions that perform compute-on-demand services. Azure also includes various communication strategies to let these various components pass data to each other. Learn how to leverage these communication services to create scalable, efficient solutions out of testable components. This learning path can help you prepare for the Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate certification.

## Choose a messaging model in Azure to loosely connect your services

[Choose a messaging model in Azure to loosely connect your services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-a-messaging-model-in-azure-to-connect-your-services/) (~45 mins)

When you have an application that consists of components running on different computers, servers, and mobile devices, reliable communications between those components can be difficult and unreliable. Azure provides several technologies that you can use to communicate more reliably, including Storage queues, Event Hubs, Event Grid, and Service Bus. This module shows you how to choose the best technology for your communication task.
