## Execute an Azure Function with triggers

[Execute an Azure Function with triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/execute-azure-function-with-triggers/) (~1 hr 23 mins)

A trigger is responsible for executing an Azure function and there are dozens of triggers to choose from. This module will you show you some of the most common types of triggers and how to configure them to execute your logic.

In this module, you will:

- Determine which trigger works best for your business needs
- Create a timer trigger to invoke a function on a consistent schedule
- Create an HTTP trigger to invoke a function when an HTTP request is received
- Create a blob trigger to invoke a function when a blob is created or updated in Azure Storage

## Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings

[Chain Azure Functions together using input and output bindings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/chain-azure-functions-data-using-bindings/) (~1 hr 10 mins)

Azure Functions makes it easy for your function code to integrate with data and services. Through the power of bindings, you declare the data sources to read and write, and let Azure Functions take care of the rest.

In this module, you will:

- Explore what types of data sources can be accessed through bindings
- Read data from Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Functions
- Store data in Azure Cosmos DB using Azure Functions
- Send messages to Azure Queue Storage using Azure Functions

[Monitor GitHub events by using a webhook with Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/monitor-github-events-with-a-function-triggered-by-a-webhook/) (~53 mins)

Webhooks offer a lightweight mechanism for your app to be notified by another service when something of interest happens. In this module. you'll learn how to trigger an Azure function with a GitHub webhook and parse the payload for insights.

In this module, you will:

- Trigger your function with a webhook
- Analyze the message from the webhook
- Secure webhook payloads with a secret

Prerequisites:

- Beginner-level knowledge of Azure Functions
- A GitHub account
