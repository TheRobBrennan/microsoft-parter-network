## Friday, July 10th, 2020

- Reassess and evaluate your approach
  - After taking a few practice questions, I did NOT score as well as I had hoped. I tried a sampling of five (5) questions - with the recommended goal of achieving an 80% or higher score. The materials I have reviewed and hands-on labs I have accomplished to date have provided a solid overview. Still, they were nowhere close to providing the specific technical questions that are being asked on the test.
  - Used today to regroup a little and lick my wounds. It's time for a change...and I have a few ideas in mind that I want to chase down.

![../exams/AZ-204:%20Developing%20Solutions%20for%20Microsoft%20Azure/courses/Whizlabs%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Exam%20AZ-204%20Certification/notes/2020.07.13%20result.png](../exams/AZ-204:%20Developing%20Solutions%20for%20Microsoft%20Azure/courses/Whizlabs%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Exam%20AZ-204%20Certification/notes/2020.07.13%20result.png)

FAILED: 11 / 15 correct for a 73.33% score.

Areas for me to revisit include:

- CORRECT answer on using [az webapp log config](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/webapp/log?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-log-config)
- INCORRECT answer selecting `user_impersonation` instead of `User.Read` on [Acquire a token from Azure AD for authorizing requests from a client application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-app)
- INCORRECT answer selecting `oauth2AllowImplicitFlow` instead of `oauth2Permissions` in the [application manifest file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest)
- INCORRECT answer selecting `Azure App Service Environment` instead of `Integration Service Environment` for securing a Logic App to the corporate virtual network
  - See [Announcing Azure Integration Service Environment for Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-azure-integration-service-environment-for-logic-apps/)
- INCORRECT answer selecting `Configure the web application to use the Premium App Service Plan` instead of `Configure the web application to use the Standard App Service Plan` when the app service plan is `D1` and on a `Shared Service Plan` - We simply need to upgrade to the `Standard App Service Plan`; no need to jump to Premium.

RETAKE - ATTEMPT #2: [Fifteen (15) question practice exam](https://www.whizlabs.com/learn/course/microsoft-azure-az-204/)

Haha oh man. Thought I'd retake the 15 question sampler - since it appeared as an option for this course...yeah. Turns out it's the same 15 questions. Hell of an ego boost, though - only took me ~2 mins and 18 seconds to fly through it and score a perfect 15/15 ðŸ¤£

- [How to write stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions in Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-write-stored-procedures-triggers-udfs) - REMEMBER: For this CosmosDB function, you first get the context, then get the response from the context variable. Process the response however you'd like, and then use response.setBody() as the last step.

  ```js
  var helloWorldStoredProc = {
    id: "helloWorld",
    serverScript: function () {
      var context = getContext()
