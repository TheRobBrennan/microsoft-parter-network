I was making my way through those learning paths suggested by Microsoft for the Azure DevOps competency I'm shooting for, and while they were useful and provided some practical hands on experience, I took a quick five question sampler to see how I would score...and the suggested score was 80% for those five questions. I only hit 40% - mostly because there were a lot of really specific technical questions that simply weren't covered whatsoever in the learning path modules.

To that end, I am shifting gears to a specific course targeting AZ-204 which would require a day or two of video watching and lab exercises plus the ability to take four (4) full practice exams.
